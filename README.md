# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Python. The analysis begins with loading an Excel dataset, followed by data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and data quality issues.
The objective is to prepare a reliable dataset and generate meaningful insights through structured analysis.

## 📁 Dataset

* **Format:** Excel (`.xlsx`)
* **Type:** Structured tabular data
* **Loaded Using:** Pandas (`read_excel`)
* **Content:** Contains multiple numerical and categorical variables used for analysis

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data loading and manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔄 Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Imported the Excel dataset into Python
* Verified structure, column names, and data types

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicate records
* Standardized column names
* Corrected data types and inconsistencies

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Generated summary statistics
* Analyzed distributions and trends
* Identified outliers and relationships
* Created visualizations to support findings

---

## 📊 Dashboard

* Visual insights generated using Python charts
* Includes:

  * Distribution plots
  * Comparison charts
  * Trend analysis visuals

*(Optional: Add screenshots or notebook visuals here)*
